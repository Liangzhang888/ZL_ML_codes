## About me 

I am a postgraduate majored in Machine Learning for IED (Interictal Epileptiform Discharges) detection using EEG or MEG data.

## About this respository

This respository was created for sharing the  experiment code in my studies. I am glad if it is any use to you.

### V2IED

This folder contains my reproduction code for the V2IED paper. As the original author of the paper did not disclose the code, this is just my opinion. If there are any errors or omissions, please feel free to raise an issue for discussion.
